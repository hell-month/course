# Day 0

Welcome to Day 0 of the Hell Month course!

Throughout this course, you will learn the basics of DApp development as well as decentralized finance based on [Uniswap V2 contracts](https://github.com/hell-month/v2-core).

## Core values

Here're the most important values we want to instill in you:
1. **English-first**: We will use English as the primary language for all course materials and discussions, no matter who you are. The reason is simple: English is the lingua franca of the blockchain world, and we want you to be trained to understand technical concepts in English, even if it might not be your first language.
1. **Open-source**: All course materials will be open-sourced, and we encourage you to contribute back. This is not just about learning; it's about building a community of developers who can help each other grow.
1. **Hands-on**: We believe in **learning by doing**. No more passive listening. Each day will include practical milestones to reinforce your understanding of the concepts covered.
1. **AI assisted**: You can always search on Google or ChatGPT. In most cases, they will give you the right answer to each step you need to take. This leads to our next point, which is **Goal-oriented**.
1. **Goal-oriented**: We won't provide you with step-by-step instructions or straightforward solutions. Instead, **we will give you the goal and let you figure out the details.** This is to help you develop problem-solving skills and become a more independent developer. Achieving any goals should be a no-brainer if you can Google it, right?

## Prerequisites

Since this course is designed for anyone regardless of their background, we want to make sure you have the necessary prerequisites to get started.

You can skip this section if you already know what's going on, as these are just the basics.

### Goal #1

1. Create a KYC'ed account at any CEX, and put some money into your account. It could be [Binance](https://binance.com), [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/), [Upbit](https://upbit.com/), [Bithumb](https://www.bithumb.com/react/), or any other centralized exchange. Once you are successful, you will be able to buy some crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum there.

2. Install a non-custodial wallet as an extension on Chrome. You can use [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/), [Rainbow](https://rainbow.me/), or any other wallet that supports Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens. Make sure to back up your seed phrase securely.

> **Note**: Again, if you are not familiar with any of the terms above, you MUST use Google or AI to help you understand them. This is a crucial step to ensure you can follow along with the course. We will NOT explain everything to you.
