## Course structure

### Meta-goals

- Able to spin up a local development environment and run end-to-end tests with it
- Able to deploy Uniswap v2 contracts to testnet, interact with it, and connect with frontend and backand
- Able to use Foundry
- Able to understand and explain the big picture behind Uniswap V2 and CPAMM model
- Able to understand the Uniswap v2 contracts (v2-core and v2-periphery ) line-by-line

### Live tutorials

- All live tutorials are about 1-1.5 hours long
- Live tutorials are recorded
- Live tutorials will serve primarily as code/setup/demo sessions and NOT unidirectional university-like lectures

### Assignments

- After every tutorial, there's an assignment that you need to finish. Completing the assignments are the only way to achieve milestones.
- Milestones are verified using deployments onto testnet (e.g., seeing if a function belonging to a contract deployed by a student on testnet works as intended or not)

### Inclusivity

- The course aims to cater beginner/advanced levels at the same time. At times, you will see two different tracks catered for either group.
